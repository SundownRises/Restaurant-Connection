Project Introduction: Nearby Restaurant Meetup App


Overview

The Nearby Restaurant Meetup App is a web-based platform designed to simplify the process of discovering, sharing, and coordinating restaurant meetups with friends and family. Utilizing data from Google Maps API, users can explore restaurants near their current location, check their reviews and ratings, and create a personalized Go-to List of favorite spots they wish to visit in the future. This list can be shared with their contacts, allowing others to see the restaurants the user is interested in and easily coordinate meetups.

The app bridges the gap between discovering new restaurants and planning casual meetups with friends by providing a convenient platform for interaction, discovery, and social engagement.


Key Features

Location-Based Restaurant Discovery:

The app utilizes Google Maps API to fetch a list of nearby restaurants based on the user’s current location.
The app displays key information about each restaurant, including:
Name
Location
Ratings and reviews
Operating hours
Distance from the user's current location


Personalized Go-to List:

Users can "star" or "like" restaurants to add them to a personal Go-to List.
This list acts as a personalized set of preferred restaurants that the user wishes to visit in the near future.


Sharing Go-to List with Contacts:

The app integrates with the user’s contact list, allowing them to share their Go-to List with friends, family, or colleagues.
The shared Go-to List will allow contacts to see which restaurants the user has saved, and they can directly contact the user to plan a meetup.


User Interaction and Coordination:

Contacts can view the user's Go-to List, check restaurant details, and coordinate directly with the user to set up a time and place for a meetup.
Users can also see which restaurants their friends have starred, fostering a sense of social interaction.


Review and Rating-Based Filtering:

Restaurants can be filtered based on their Google reviews and ratings, ensuring users have the best possible options in terms of quality and user satisfaction.
This helps users quickly find highly rated or trending spots nearby.


Target Audience
The Nearby Restaurant Meetup App is designed for individuals who:

Frequently explore new dining options and like discovering new places to eat.

Want to conveniently plan meetups with friends and family without the hassle of coordinating through multiple platforms.

Enjoy sharing personal recommendations for restaurants with their social circles.


The app is especially useful for:

Food enthusiasts who frequently explore new restaurants and want to create personalized lists of favorites.

Core Functionality

The app consists of three primary components:

Restaurant Discovery:

Using the Google Maps Places API, the app retrieves restaurants based on the user’s real-time location.
Restaurants are displayed in a visually appealing manner (e.g., through a map or list view), providing users with detailed information and ratings.


List Management:

Users can add restaurants to their Go-to List with a simple “like” or “star” functionality.
The Go-to List is easily accessible and can be modified by adding or removing restaurants.


Social Sharing and Meetup Coordination:

Users can share their Go-to List with selected contacts or their entire contact list.
The shared list provides contacts with the option to view and suggest meetups at these starred locations.
